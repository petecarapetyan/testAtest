# Starter Project for Java with Maven support.

A template starter for instantiating a plain java project, with Maven metadata

## If You Can't See Green 'Use this template' Button

If instead you see the green 'Code' button then you are not signed in to github.

## Advantages to using this project

- You won't be confused by, and forced to use static methods and class variables that you don't yet understand.
- Easy to set up and get started
- Sets up some defaults to use as examples for getting started coding
- Perhaps more like the projects you will be using on the job

## Disadvantages to using this project

- Slightly different project than what the video lessons show
- More material here than you will initially need
- Shows unit test that you won't do until Assignment 7

## How to Consume Template

- Create your project on github, not your local drive, by clicking the green template button
- Clone this down to your local drive in the appropriate workspace directory
- Import this project as an existing Maven project
- Start your coding in App.java's execute() method

ALWAYS rename your project from `FIXME`, after importing! See troubleshooting below!!!!! (Right click, "Refactor" then "Rename")
ALWAYS search your project for the string literal `FIXME`, and fix any as appropriate (such as pom.xml file)

## How to run app

In Eclipse run App.java as a java app as you would any other app

## How To run Unit Tests

In Eclipse run MyServiceTest as JUnit test

## Troubleshooting

- A second project from this template will NOT import into a workspace if you didn't refactor the name of a previous. Hint: Look for a project in your workspace starting with the name `FIXME` and then rename that project.
- If your IDE is not set up with Java 11, you may expect problems that require you to add a Java 11 JDK in order to resolve. PS you need to do this anyway - your code reviewer expects that regardless of what you use as your project starter.


## To remove unwanted boilerplate

Some example code is included in this project. Depending on your skill level ... 

- You may wish to delete it immediately if it is not helpful
- You may wish to leave it around for a while if it might be helpful

But if you hand this project in as an assignment, you probably want to delete anything that is not a part of the assignment.

## How To Clean Up Before Handing In as Assignment

This project includes a bunch of boilerplate for demonstration purposes only. Assuming none of these become a part of your project ... here's how to remove them before handing your project in for a review.

FIRST COMMIT YOUR PROJECT WITH GIT BEFORE YOU START!

First remove these:

- AppConstants.java
- MyService.java
- MyServiceTest.java
- data.txt


Then (optionally) remove any empty package folders

You can then go into Eclipse and little red squiggles will tell you what else needs to be deleted.

Make sure your assignment still runs perfectly!

## Other notes:

- This project attempts to enforce a Java 11 version on the user. This is intentional, as this is a standard in the bootcamp.
- This project is like it's sibling project, which is virtually identical except for being a maven project import.
- Some teams prefer to gitignore the Eclipse metadata files (.project, .classpath) - but this would defeat this template's usage.
- This project will also import into IntelliJ
